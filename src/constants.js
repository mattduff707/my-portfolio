    text: `I've been an avid strength training enthusiast for about 5 years now (with a year-long pause due to COVID-19).
       I worked as a strength coach in Chicago for just over a year. This was my first dip into self-education as I
       learned the necessary material for my training certification. Learning how to learn played a key role in my web development journey, and it started here.
        Acting as an educator for those taking their first steps into the intimidating world of fitness and health was humbling and inspiring. 
         Although I no longer pursue strength training as a career, it will forever be a passionate hobby of mine. Yeah, buddy! `,

     he bought his first home computer in the early 80s. In a way, it seemed preordained that I would also become an enthusiast through his influence.
      YouTube has been a major source of entertainment and education throughout my life, especially during this professional transition. I have been an avid PC gamer since the age of 5,
     living vicariously through Pajama Sam is where the interest sparked. My favorites along the way include Diablo 2, Rocket League, and World of Warcraft.`,

     Knowing the lives of others may be positively impacted by my decisions today fuels me to take the necessary actions to ignite change.
     That extends to my interest in web development. I have a keen interest in specializing in accessibility going forward.
     My mother has dedicated her life to assisting those in the disabled community.
     She was an ASL interpreter for 18 years and now works as a home care provider for people with mental/physical disabilities.
     As an inspiration to me, I aspire to achieve even a fraction of the impact she has made in people's lives.
